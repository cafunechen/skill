Differential Evolution Algorithm (SHADE) including Linear
population size reduction (L-SHADE), enhanced with adaptive
constraint violation handling, applied to the benchmark for CEC
2017 Competition on Constrained Real-Parameter Optimization.
The constraint handling method prioritizes the feasible solutions
before infeasible, while disregarding the constraint violation
values below an adaptive threshold, i.e. adaptive -constraint
handling. The 28 constrained test functions on 10, 30, 50, and
100 dimensions are assessed on the benchmark and the required
resulting final fitnesses, constraints violations, and success rates
are reported for 25 independent runs of the proposed algorithm
under the budget of fixed maximum number of fitness evaluations
for 10, 30, 50, and 100 dimensional test functions.
I. INTRODUCTION
This paper presents Success-History Based Adaptive Differential
Evolution Algorithm (SHADE [1]) with linear population
size reduction (L-SHADE [2]), enhanced with constraint
handling [3], [4], applied to CEC 2017 Competition on Constrained
Real-Parameter Optimization [5].
The applied constraint handling method prioritizes the
feasible solutions before infeasible, while disregarding the
constraint violation values below an adaptive threshold, i.e.
adaptive -constraint handling [6], [3], [4]. The 28 constrained
test functions on 10, 30, 50, and 100 dimensions are assessed
on the CEC benchmark and the resulting final fitnesses,
constraints violations, and success rates are reported for 25
independent runs of the proposed algorithm under the budget
of fixed maximum number of fitness evaluations.
In the next section, related work is presented. The description
of the proposed constrained L-SHADE follows in Section
3. Section 4 reports experiments and Section 5 conclusions
with future work.
II. RELATED WORK
A. Differential Evolution and Optimization
Differential Evolution (DE) was introduced by Storn and
Price [7] using a floating-point encoding evolutionary algorithm
[8] for global optimization over continuous spaces.
There exist several recent surveys and insights with the algorithmâ€™s
base name [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14] and its
metaphors [15], [16], [17] stemming from the progress on
computational mechanisms mainly from the branches of DE.
The basic DE [7] consists of an evolutionary loop over
generations, within which new population D-dimensional vectors
xi, 8i 2 f1; 2; :::;NPg are evolved. During each generation
step number g, computational operators like mutation,
crossover, and selection on the population are performed, until
a termination criterion is satisfied, like a fixed number of
maximum fitness evaluations (MAXFES). DE and recently the
L-SHADE [2] as applied in this paper, has also been extended
with several enhancements for unconstrained optimization,
like [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23].
DE is also used for constraint optimization [24] and there
are several variants which entered past competitions held at the
IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) [25]. A
comparison of several constraint-handling techniques entering
these competitions was recently demonstrated in [4] on an
uniform framework of limited fitness evaluation budget for
underwater robotics challenge in robust glider path planning,
showcasing some well known algorithms, like SaDE [26],
